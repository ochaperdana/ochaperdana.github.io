## What to do first?

Mastering Scrum will be super easy to do. But sometimes, you do have to considerate some amount of time to start contemplating and make sure what to do first, what to do next, what things that you will face.
But, don't worry. Lot of resources will surely be helping you. Just make sure that you spend some amount of time to do research, to read more, to practice more.

## Expectation vs Reality

Doing Scrum might sounds super sexy for most of you, because you might think, "that's what big-tech company do."
Well, that's partially right, but I will not sugarcoat anything in this post. Doing Scrum is good, but it also depends on the resources.
First thing first, make sure that all of your resource will meet the minimum requirement to do a Scrum.
Also, there will be a lot of obstacles during the process, which related to the time-span for doing a sprint on Scrum, make sure your colleagues are capable enough to do that as well.

## What to Expect Then?

Suit yourself. No need to be worry with the 'disruptive'-thingy, it will lead you nowhere if you got nothing on hands.
